Super cool organizer

## Hosting Service
Heroku seems to be a good place to host our application, `it's free`
We can setup the heroku tool belt when we all meet up.

## Development Practice
It would be best that we use a development branch to push all our changes to Github and make a pull request to the master branch. That way we can all get a chance to review the code before we change our master branch.


## Technologies
- MongoDB
- Angular 1.x or 2.x?
- NodeJs
- ExpressJs
- Angular Material?
- GulpJs

<i>We can discuss these later</i>
